# Financial News Sentiment Analysis

## Project Overview
This project aims to analyze the sentiment of financial news headlines and establish correlations with stock price movements. Using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques, statistical methods, and Python libraries, the analysis focuses on uncovering actionable insights to predict stock market trends. This work is part of a week-long challenge designed to simulate real-world financial analytics tasks.
